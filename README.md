environment variables.

* Before you begin, make sure you have an account in [Dome9](https://secure.dome9.com/).

## Getting Started
One can start using Dome9 Go SDK by initializing client and making a request. 
Here is an example of getting IP List.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"dome9"
	"services/iplist"
)


func main() {
	accessID := "123456789123456789" // your API ID
	secretKey := "passpasspass"      // you API Secret
	config := dome9.DefaultConfig()
	config.SetCredentials(accessID, secretKey)

	srv := iplist.New(config)
    ipListID := 77281
	res, _, _ := srv.Get(ipListID)
	fmt.Println(res)


}
```
